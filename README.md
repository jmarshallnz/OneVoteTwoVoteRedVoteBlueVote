=============================

A very, very rough election simulator for seeing likely outcomes based in New Zealand's MMP election based on poll data. This is to deal with the problem that most polls will give you headline figures, but not give you a sense of how likely various outcomes are.

The basic idea is to use R to run a whole bunch of imaginary elections, where the parties have support similar to that expressed in polling results. Because under MMP government formation is not just a matter of the single party that gets the most votes is the winner.
